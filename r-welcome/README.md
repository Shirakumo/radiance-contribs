## About
This module provides a welcoming screen page, used for first-time setups. The following pages are set up:

```
/    ; => Shows a welcome page
/404 ; => Signals a REQUEST-NOT-FOUND condition
/403 ; => Signals a REQUEST-DENIED condition
/500 ; => Signals an INTERNAL-ERROR condition
```

The latter three pages are there to test error pages.
